1. Extract the texture files from valorant
2. Find the average color based on all the textures
- get 3rd person textures

- Can consider:
	BASIC
	- map textures colors (only if a lot of screenshots taken)
		- maybe can group by maps
	
	ADVANCED/IDEAL
	- enemy outline color?
	- enemy agent color?
		- maybe can group by agent combination
	
	OVER THE TOP
	- enemy gun skin color?	(varies too much)
	- enemy gun buddy color? (too much effort, too little reward)
3. The complementary color to that color would be the best crosshair color
